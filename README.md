The design of this website was create by Elias (https://github.com/hayk-simonyan), and I am just learning from it, so all credit goes to him.

I wrote the code with a few of my own features and my information for learning purposes only.

I am learning the development side of DevOps, as I am already familiar Operations side for the most part.
